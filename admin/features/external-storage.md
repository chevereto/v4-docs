# External storage

External storage allows to use external servers for storing user uploads, which helps to leverage your server load and deliver a more reliable website. If you use multiple external storage servers, it will help to distribute the traffic of these assets.

External storage works by adding a external storage server where file uploads will be stored. This external storage server expose those files using HTTP, enabling users and visitors of your Chevereto installation to access these images directly.

## Storage URL

::: tip Storage server provided
The storage server must provide the URL for public-read file access. Check the documentation of your service provider.
:::

Chevereto maps external storage uploads to the corresponding external storage server using the given Storage URL as a base URL to locate that file in the external storage.

Using Amazon S3 with direct storage:

| Property     | Value                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Bucket       | `my-bucket`                                    |
| Storage URL  | `https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/`          |
| Stored image | `my-bucket/image.jpg`                          |
| Mapped URL   | `https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/image.jpg` |

::: tip CNAME
Is recommended that you use URLs that match your domain so try to take advantage of using a [CNAME record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record).
:::

Amazon S3 with folder-based storage and custom CNAME (`img.domain.com`):

| Property     | Value                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bucket       | `my-bucket`                                             |
| Storage URL  | `https://img.domain.com/my-bucket/`                     |
| Stored image | `/my-bucket/2020/10/06/image.jpg`                       |
| Mapped URL   | `https://img.domain.com/my-bucket/2020/10/06/image.jpg` |

## Storage URL with CDN

Add a CDN for each storage URL you want to use. At your CDN provider create a pull zone for the origin storage URL.

If you are using Amazon S3, the source (origin) URL will be something like this:

```sh
https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/
```

The CDN URL provided by your CDN service will be something like this:

```sh
https://pullzone-url.at.cdn-service.com/
```

Adding a CNAME record for the above URL will allow you to end up with a Storage URL like this:

```sh
https://s3-cdn.domain.com/
```

## Alibaba Cloud OSS

The Alibaba Cloud OSS API allows to upload images to [Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Object Storage System (OSS)](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/oss/).

## Amazon S3

The Amazon S3 API allows to upload images to an [Amazon S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) bucket. You will need an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) account for this.

- To setup Amazon S3:
  - Create access credentials from [Identity and Access Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#users) console
  - Click on "Create New Users", make sure to enable "Programmatic access"
  - On permissions, associate **AmazonS3FullAccess**
  - Store the **user name**, **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** at the end of the process
  - Create a bucket from the [S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3)
  - Click on "Create a Bucket" and proceed to create a bucket
  - On permissions, make sure "Block new public ACLs" and "Remove public access" are unchecked (Public access settings)
  - Store the **bucket name** and the **region**
  - You don't need to setup logging

If you want to use a custom domain follow the [CNAME](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingCustomURLs) documentation. Otherwise just make sure that the [Storage URL](#storage-url) ends with `/<your_bucket_name>/`

## Backblaze B2
