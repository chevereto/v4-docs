# 🖼 API Version 1

Chevereto API v1 allows to upload pictures as guest to your Chevereto powered website.

API v1 doesn't have rate limiting but is affected by the configured flood upload limit in your admin dashboard. You should only use this API for your very own applications or scripts, is not intended for public usage.

## Key

API v1 works with a single API key that you can set at Dashboard > Settings > API.

## Call

### Request method

API v1 calls can be done using the POST or GET request methods but since GET request are limited by the maximum allowed length of an URL you should prefer the POST request method.

### Request URL

```plain
http://mysite.com/api/1/<action>/
```

### Parameters

- key The API v1 key, it can be set in your admin dashboard settings.
- action What you want to do [values: upload].
- source Either a image URL or a [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded image string. You can also use FILES["source"] in your request.
- format Sets the return format [values: json (default), redirect, txt].

### Example call

```plain
GET http://mysite.com/api/1/upload/?key=12345&source=http://somewebsite/someimage.jpg&format=json
```

Note: Always use POST when uploading local files. Url encoding may alter the base64 source due to encoded characters or just by URL request length limit due to GET request.

## API response

API v1 responses will vary depending on the **format** parameter:

- json Display all the image uploaded information in JSON format. [default]
- txt Returns the image direct URL in text/plain format.

## Upload to user workaround

API V1 one doesn't have a way to upload images associated with a given user but you can override the default API. Copy the default `app/routes/route.api.php` file to `app/routes/overrides/route.api.php` folder.

Change this:

```php
CHV\Image::uploadToWebsite($source);
```

To this (replace juanito with the target username or user_id):

```php
// This will upload images to 'juanito' account 
CHV\Image::uploadToWebsite($source, 'juanito');
```

By doing this, the `/api` route (sourced from `app/routes/overrides/route.api.php`) will now upload images in the name of that user.

### Using different API keys

If you want to use a different API key in this new customized API simply change this:

```plain
!G\timing_safe_compare(CHV\getSetting('api_v1_key'), $_REQUEST['key'])
```

To this:

```plain
!G\timing_safe_compare('NowThisIsAnotherAPIKEY!', $_REQUEST['key'])
```

### Multiple APIs

You can have multiple APIs long as you perform some editing at `app/loader.php`. Since this file handles some pre-routing, you need to add your custom routes to all the conditionals mentioning `api`.
