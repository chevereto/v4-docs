# Install Chevereto on Docker

::: tip Installation service available
We offer a [paid installation service](https://chevereto.com/support) for this guide. We will install Chevereto Docker for you, including all the requirements and configurations.
:::

Roll your own multi-website Chevereto infrastructure with Chevereto Docker, a Docker-based system that allows you to deploy and maintain one or multiple Chevereto websites on demand.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have your own Chevereto Docker up and running, capable of deploying and maintaining multiple Chevereto websites on demand, all with automatic sub-domain creation and renewable HTTPS certificates.

## Advantages

There are several advantages of our Docker system:

* Run multiple websites with ease
* Portability
* Easy to update
* Automatic HTTPS setup
* CloudFlare integration

## Repository

Check the project repository at [chevereto/docker](https://github.com/chevereto/docker) for all instructions and source code.

## Requirements

To follow this guide, make sure you have:

* Ubuntu server with shell access and public IP address.
* Domain managed by CloudFlare (if using integration)
* Chevereto license (required for the paid edition)
  * [Purchase](https://chevereto.com/pricing) new license
  * [Access](https://chevereto.com/panel/license) existing purchase

## Getting a server

You'll need a server where you can install Chevereto Docker For this guide we recommend an Ubuntu 24.04 server, but any Unix-like system will do.

## Accessing server shell

To interact with your server use a terminal emulator. Here are some terminal emulator software by operating system:

| System  | Software                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| macOS   | Terminal, iTerm 2            |
| Windows | Windows Terminal, Putty      |
| Linux   | Gnome Terminal, Tilix, XTerm |

Access your server via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) using the following command from your computer:

```sh
ssh root@<server ip>
```

Make sure to check your server provider's documentation for specific instructions on accessing the shell.

## Installing chevereto/docker

Start by installing Chevereto Docker repository and its dependencies by running the following command.

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://chevereto.com/sh/ubuntu/24.04/docker.sh)
```

## Setting up CloudFlare integration

Skip this section if you don't need CloudFlare integration to manage domain DNS.

Integrate Chevereto Docker with CloudFlare to automate sub-domain creation for your websites. If you aren't using CloudFlare go to [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com) to get started, it is free. Add your domain to continue with this guide.

To setup CloudFlare with Chevereto Docker:

* Navigate to the DNS configuration for your domain on CloudFlare.
* Create a new A record, take note as it will be your `CLOUDFLARE_A_NAME` environment value. Use the following properties:
  * Type: A
  * Name: chevereto-factory
  * Content: {server ip}
  * Proxy status: DNS only
  * TTL: Auto
* Navigate to SSL/TLS configuration and under **Overview** set mode to **Full (strict)**.

Next create an API token, take note as it will be your `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` environment value.

* Go to [api-tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) and click on **Create Token**
* Use template **Edit zone DNS**
* Permissions: **Zone DNS Edit**
* Resources: **Include Specific zone DOMAIN**

You will require to take note on `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` which you can get from the **domain overview**.

## Create configuration (.env file)

To create the configuration file run the following command and follow the on-screen instructions.

```sh
make env
```

* `CHEVERETO_LICENSE_KEY`: Your Chevereto license key (required for the paid edition, leave empty for free edition).
* `DOMAIN`: The domain/hostame you'll use for spawning Chevereto installations.
* `EMAIL_HTTPS`: The email to receive HTTPS certificate notifications from Letâ€™s Encrypt.
* `CLOUDFLARE_*` options: Integration details for CloudFlare.

## Setting up system

By setting up the system you will enable background processing and nginx ingress HTTP proxy.

To set up the system run the following command:

```sh
make setup
```

## Building the Chevereto image

If you're using free edition you can skip this step, as the image is freely available on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto/pkgs/container/chevereto).

Build the Chevereto container image for the latest release by running the following command.

```sh
make image
```

## Deploying

To deploy a new website use the following command format:

```sh
make deploy NAMESPACE={namespace} ADMIN_EMAIL={email} DOMAIN={domain}
```

Where:

* `NAMESPACE`: The name of the sub-domain for your website (e.g. `demo`).
* `ADMIN_EMAIL`: The email address for the website admin (e.g. `email@mywebsite.com`).
* `DOMAIN`: The domain name for the website (e.g. `mydomain.com`).

For example:

```sh
make deploy NAMESPACE=demo ADMIN_EMAIL=email@mywebsite.com DOMAIN=mydomain.com
```

The Chevereto website will be available within seconds as the new sub-domain propagates.

## Upgrading

To upgrade you need to (1) Sync repository, (2) Re-build the container image, and (3) Update Chevereto instances.

### Step 1: Sync repository

Sync this repository to get the latest changes.

```sh
make sync
```

**Note:** If there's a new branch (for example 4.2) switch to that branch running the following command:

```sh
git switch 4.2
```

### Step 2: Re-build the container image

Build a new container image to reflect the newest release.

```sh
make image
```

### Step 3: Update Chevereto instances

This will down and re-up the containers and carry the required database update.

```sh
make update
```
