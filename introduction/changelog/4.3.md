## Application-level cache

Chevereto is now faster.

Application-level caching stores frequently accessed data in memory, reducing repeated database queries. This improves performance, speeds up page loads, and decreases server load, especially for data that doesn't change often.

## Chunked uploads

Upload large files reliably.

Chevereto now supports chunked uploads, allowing users to upload large files in smaller parts. This is especially useful for high-resolution images or videos, and improves reliability and performance in environments with limited bandwidth or unstable connections.

## Lossless JPEG handling

Pixel perfect bitmaps.

Chevereto now supports lossless JPEG auto-orientation, automatically adjusting JPEG orientation based on EXIF data. It can also remove EXIF data losslessly during upload, preserving the original image quality.

## Semantics for file, tag, and video

Thank you, but I prefer it my way.

Chevereto now includes custom semantics for file, tag, and video management. This enables better organization and categorization of uploaded content, making it easier to manage and retrieve files based on specific criteria.

## GoPro 360 photos

Immersive 360Â° content.

Chevereto now supports GoPro 360 photos, allowing users to upload and share immersive 360-degree images captured with GoPro cameras. This feature enhances the platform for users who want to showcase 360-degree content with the built-in viewer.

## Cloudflare Turnstile captcha

Enhanced privacy and protection.

Chevereto expands anti-bot protection by adding [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/turnstile/) alongside reCAPTCHA v2, v3, and hCaptcha. This gives users more flexibility in choosing a CAPTCHA solution, whether prioritizing ease of use, privacy, or bot mitigation. Turnstile's privacy-friendly, frictionless approach aligns with Chevereto's commitment to user experience, offering a seamless alternative without Google dependencies.
