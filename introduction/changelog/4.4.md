# 4.4 Vivaracho

*Vivaracho is currently under development.*

Chevereto v4.4, codenamed [**Vivaracho**](https://dle.rae.es/vivaracho), adds first-class multitenancy, enabling you to provision, isolate, and administer multiple independent sites from a single installation.

## Environment changes

The following environment variables have been added:

`CHEVERETO_ENABLE_TENANTS`

This variable controls multitenancy support in Chevereto. When set to `1`, it will be possible to create multiple independent sites within a single Chevereto infrastructure.

`CHEVERETO_TENANT_ENFORCED`

This variable allows defining a JSON object with environment variables that will be late enforced (overridden) on runtime for each tenant. This provides a way to set default configurations that apply to all tenants, while still allowing individual tenants to override specific settings as needed.

`CHEVERETO_TENANT`

When running Chevereto in multi-tenant mode, this variable specifies the target tenant for command-line interface (CLI) operations. It should be set to the unique tenant ID of the desired tenant.

`CHEVERETO_TENANTS_PUBLIC_KEY`

This variable is required to verify signed requests to the [Tenants API](../../api/4/tenants.md). It should contain the public key corresponding to the private key used for signing requests.

`CHEVERETO_TENANTS_API_ALLOW_LIST`

This variable allows restricting access to the [Tenants API](../../api/4/tenants.md) by specifying a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses or networks. Only requests originating from these sources will be permitted to access the API.

`CHEVERETO_TENANTS_API_KEY_SIGNING_SECRET`

This variable is used to verify requests coming from a known [Tenants API](../../api/4/tenants.md) key.

`CHEVERETO_PROVIDER_NAME`

This variable is required in `CHEVERETO_CONTEXT=saas` setups to specify the service provider name for the Chevereto instance.

`CHEVERETO_PROVIDER_URL`

This variable is required in `CHEVERETO_CONTEXT=saas` setups to specify the service provider URL for the Chevereto instance.
