## What is Chevereto?

Chevereto is a self-hosted multi-user, full-featured media hosting solution. It can be used to create a myriad of applications or to empower existing systems, all around the concept of users hosting and interacting with media content.

## Use cases

Chevereto default use case is as a media hosting service, but it can be extended to do more than that. The API is pluggable and the system is modular, you can implement it progressively in any project.

💡 Chevereto could be used to build your store's gallery, a client portfolio, manage thousand of media assets and more.

👏 From a simple media gallery up to end-users interacting with each-other, Chevereto can leverage all the load of the media sharing layer for your project.

## Core Concepts

### Community Driven

A [community](https://chevereto.com/community) drives the development for Chevereto. Users from all over the world help to shape this software.

### Headless

Chevereto is headless software, on its core is a self-exposed REST API made for _any_ user interface.

Although it provides a default [user interface](https://github.com/chevereto/peafowl), you are encouraged to bring your own user interface, which it can be a website, desktop/mobile application or even a CLI tool.

### Pluggable

Chevereto is designed with pluggable logic, enabling you to add what you need to make it more yours.

💡 Use plugins to extend your installation and to create a better user experience for your unique needs.

## Origin

Chevereto began in 2007 as a self-hosted alternative to ImageShack. It started as one-click image hosting service and here we are.
